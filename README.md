# array-id-import-pipeline
import AffyMetrix ids for rat, mouse, human and other species (if available) into ALIASES table.

We use synergizer.jar java library (as described here: http://llama.mshri.on.ca/synergizer/doc/) to translate NCBI gene ids
associated with active genes in RGD into array ids.
